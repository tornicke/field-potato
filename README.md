<h1>Project 1: Field Potato</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The idea behind this challenge was to build a front-end interactive and responsive application that utilizes at least two server-side APIs. We decided to build an app that promotes movement and doing activities outside the user's home (hence the name "Field Potato", in contrast to "couch potato"). The "Field Potato" app allows users to look up information about TV shows and save the shows to their list. Each show is accompanied with a mystery activity, which the user can reveal. Users can generate new activities if they are not happy with the first suggestion. Faced with a decision between spending more time in front of the TV or getting out of their comfort zone, we hope many of our users will be inspired to explore the field.</p>

<h2>User Story</h2>
<p>AS A user who is interested in TV shows, I WANT TO look up information about TV shows and when I add them to my list I want to have the chance to see an alternative activity to do, SO THAT I can compare my original pastime idea with the suggested one.
</p>

<h2>User Persona</h2>
<p>Our user persona is Ingrid, a 26-year-old woman, who would like to make some changes to her life.</p>

<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>
<li>GIVEN I am using the "Field Potato" app, WHEN I open the app, THEN the search bar is displayed at the top of the page,</li>
<li>WHEN I search for a TV show, THEN I am presented with information about that show,</li>

<li>WHEN I save the show to my list, THEN a row appears with the show name,</li>
<li>WWHEN I want to generate an alternative activity and click on the respective button, THEN a randomly suggested activity appears,</li>
<li>WHEN I add more shows to my list, THEN I can save the five most recent additions to my list,</li>
<li>WHEN I refresh the page, THEN I see the five most recent additions to my list.</li>

The below screenshots show the app at different stages:

1. When loading the page for the first time (when the user's local storage is clean)
