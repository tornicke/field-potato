<h1>Project 1: Field Potato</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The idea behind this challenge was to build a front-end interactive and responsive application that utilizes at least two server-side APIs. We decided to build an app that promotes movement and doing activities outside the user's home (hence the name "Field Potato", in contrast to "couch potato"). The "Field Potato" app allows users to look up information about TV shows and save the shows to their list. Each show is accompanied with a mystery activity, which the user can reveal. Users can generate new activities if they are not happy with the first suggestion. Faced with a decision between spending more time in front of the TV or getting out of their comfort zone, we hope many of our users will be inspired to explore the field.</p>

<h2>User Story</h2>
<p>AS A user who is interested in TV shows, I WANT TO look up information about TV shows and when I add them to my list I want to have the chance to see an alternative activity to do, SO THAT I can compare my original pastime idea with the suggested one.
</p>

<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>
<li>GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule, WHEN I open the planner, THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar</li>
<li>WHEN I scroll down, THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours</li>
<li>WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day, THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future</li>
<li>WHEN I click into a timeblock, THEN I can enter an event</li>
<li>WWHEN I click the save button for that timeblock, THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage</li>
<li>WHEN I refresh the page, THEN the saved events persist</li>

<h2>Screenshots</h2>

The below screenshots show the app at different stages:

1. When loading the page for the first time (when the user's local storage is clean)

2. When the search is made (before the show is added to the user's list)

3. When the "save" button is clicked and the modal appears (after the search has been made)

4. When one show is saved in the list

5. When five shows are saved in the list

6. When the sixth addition replaces the oldest added show in the list
